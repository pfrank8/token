## WLK Token

Ethereum SWARM is an open source project of the Ethereum Foundation being adapted and extended by Wolk Inc. to support: (1) SWARMDB, a decentralized NoSQL implementation to store and retrieve id-column-value combinations in the style of Google BigTable / Apache HBase; (2) decentralized content + data marketplaces, where providers are paid for storage, content, and data delivered through SWARM.
